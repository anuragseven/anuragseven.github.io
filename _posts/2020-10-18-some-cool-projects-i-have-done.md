         Starting From Where Is My , a flutter project,I will tell you about Beat The Culprits , built in python , it detects and recognize faces from a 
         video Stream . Next will come our NASA APOD a simple flutter app. At last I will tell you about two projects I have done in my
         college , Talking Calculator and Speech To Draw.

# Introduction:

Since I began programming I have built some really cool applications .The very first software I built was **“ Talking Calculator “** . It was built  using the  .net framework  and runs as a windows desktop application .Building It was both joy and pain. But It taught me some valuable things like **REST APIs** , how a **UI program** works , **asynchronous programming** , **databases** etc .  Since then I have coded nearly half a dozen apps  and never looked back .  Some were simple and some drove me crazy . I also didn’t constraint myself to a single platform , I built a command line app , Two desktop apps and two mobile apps and now these days I am working on a web application. Anyway let's get started , I am going to describe these projects in order :

# Virtual-Scribe

Virtual Scribe is a research-based project which allows visually impaired students to write examinations without the need of a scribe. It is completely voice-controlled and allows writing, drawing figures, and performing calculations.  We have developed a prototype of it in **PyQt5** and still working to make it industry-ready. Recently **Virtual-Scribe** won first prize in a Hackathon conducted by <a href="https://www.inclusivestem.org/">I-STEM</a>.  You can watch a demo video of it  we presented in the Hackathon:

# Beat The Culprit


A command line application built in Python . It uses **OpenCV** to detect faces from a video stream . The detected face is then sent to **Azure Face API** for recognition, to find whether  it belongs to a criminal . If it is, the responsible authorities are notified using text messages.  It was quite fun to work on it . The app was built in just 200 lines of code!
You can check this video showcasing how the app is working :

# Where Is My 

A cross platform app built using flutter framework . It keeps track of things a person often forgets about , things like keys , wallet  , credit cards etc . 
A user just needs to provide voice  input (or can directly write) like **“I placed my wallet in the drawer”** and that’s it , the app automatically finds sentiment of the phrase using **Natural Language Processing** technology . To retrieve a lost key , wallet or any other other object , the user just needs to say or write **“where is my key ”**  and the app will find its location .  Since everything is stored in a cloud database , the user has access to his data on different devices , he just needs to sign in .

# Talking Calculator


 It was the first app that I built . It was an academic project . It is  a calculator but not an ordinary one . It has buttons but it can also accept voice inputs . A user just need to say **” Multiply 15 and 17  ”** , **”What is cosine of 90 degrees  ”** etc and our app will not only calculate and display the result but also speak back it to the user! . It was built to help visually impaired and other differently abled people . It was difficult but taught some valuable things . I designed the UI and coded a part of it while travelling in the train ! It was built as a Windows Form Application . 


# NASA APOD

A simple flutter app that uses NASA APOD REST API to deliver beautiful Astronomical Pictures to users .  I am not going to describe much about it , if you are interested , you can enjoy <a href="https://anuragseven.github.io/your-post-title-flutter-nasa-astronomical-picture-of-the-day-">this tutorial</a> which describes how it was built from scratch. It also tells you things like What are **Future**s and how to handle them.

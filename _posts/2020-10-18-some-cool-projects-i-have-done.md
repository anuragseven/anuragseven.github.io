         Starting From Where Is My , a flutter project,I will tell you about Beat The Culprits , built in python , it detects and recognize faces from a 
         video Stream . Next will come our NASA APOD a simple flutter app. At last I will tell you about two projects I have done in my
         college , Talking Calculator and Speech To Draw.

# Introduction:

Since I began programming I have built some really cool applications .The very first software I built was **“ Talking Calculator “** . It was built  using the  .net framework  and runs as a windows desktop application .Building It was both joy and pain. But It taught me some valuable things like **REST APIs** , how a **UI program** works , **asynchronous programming** , **databases** etc .  Since then I have coded nearly half a dozen apps  and never looked back .  Some were simple and some drove me crazy . I also didn’t constraint myself to a single platform , I built a command line app , Two desktop apps and two mobile apps and now these days I am working on a web application. Anyway let's get started , I am going to describe these projects in order :

**Where Is My** :  A cross platform app built in flutter . It Keeps track of things people often forget about like keys , wallet etc.

**NASA APOD** : A simple flutter app which shows NASA Astronomical picture of the day . Also gives an option to view any APOD from its starting date  to today . I wrote a <a href="https://anuragseven.github.io/your-post-title-flutter-nasa-astronomical-picture-of-the-day-">whole tutorial</a> which you can check.

**Beat The Culprit** : A command line app built in Python . It uses OpenCV and Azure Face API to detect and recognize faces from a video stream.

**VocalPencil** : A Universal Windows Platform Application . It draws geometrical figures based on voice inputs given to it , like : “draw a line of length 5 units at top left”.

**Talking Calculator**:  My first app . It was a Windows Form Application . It performs Calculations based on voice inputs given to it like: “Add 2 and 3” , “2 to raise to power 10” etc.






# Where Is My 

A cross platform app built using flutter framework . It keeps track of things a person often forgets about , things like keys , wallet  , credit cards etc . 
A user just needs to provide voice  input (or can directly write) like **“I placed my wallet in the drawer”** and that’s it , the app automatically finds sentiment of the phrase using **Natural Language Processing** technology . To retrieve a lost key , wallet or any other other object , the user just needs to say or write **“where is my key ”**  and the app will find its location .  Since everything is stored in a cloud database , the user has access to his data on different devices , he just needs to sign in .

# NASA APOD

A simple flutter app that uses NASA APOD REST API to deliver beautiful Astronomical Pictures to users .  I am not going to describe much about it , if you are interested , you can enjoy <a href="https://anuragseven.github.io/your-post-title-flutter-nasa-astronomical-picture-of-the-day-">this tutorial</a> which describes how it was built from scratch. It also tells you things like What are **Future**s and how to handle them.



# Beat The Culprit


A command line application built in Python . It uses **OpenCV** to detect faces from a video stream . The detected face is then sent to **Azure Face API** for recognition, to find whether  it belongs to a criminal . If it is, the responsible authorities are notified using text messages.  It was quite fun to work on it . The app was built in just 200 lines of code!
You can check this video showcasing how the app is working :

# Vocal Pencil

It was the difficult one . It was the project that we were required to complete and submit in our college . This app takes a voice input from a user , the inputs are like this : **“Draw a line of length 5 units on the top left ”** , **“Draw a circle of radius 10 units at the centre ”**  etc.  The app then finds out the useful information from the phrase like type of figure , size , location etc and then draws the required figure on the screen. The app was built using Universal Windows Platform technology. The significance of this app is , it can be used by visually impaired students in their exams to draw geometrical figures.
Here is a video demonstrating how the app works:

# Talking Calculator


 It was the first app that I built . It was an academic project . It is  a calculator but not an ordinary one . It has buttons but it can also accept voice inputs . A user just need to say **” Multiply 15 and 17  ”** , **”What is cosine of 90 degrees  ”** etc and our app will not only calculate and display the result but also speak back it to the user! . It was built to help visually impaired and other differently abled people . It was difficult but taught some valuable things . I designed the UI and coded a part of it while travelling in the train ! It was built as a Windows Form Application .

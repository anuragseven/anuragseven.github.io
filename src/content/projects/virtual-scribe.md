## Overview

Virtual Scribe is a patented assistive technology device designed to empower individuals with visual or physical impairments to take examinations independently. The system operates entirely through voice commands, eliminating the need for human scribes, pen, and paper.

## Key Features

- **Voice-Controlled Writing**: Dictate answers naturally using speech-to-text technology
- **Mathematical Calculations**: Perform complex calculations through voice commands
- **Diagram Generation**: Create geometric figures and diagrams by describing them
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Audio confirmation of every action for verification
- **Fully Accessible**: No manual input required at any point

## How It Works

1. **Speech Recognition**: The device listens to the user's voice and converts speech to text with high accuracy
2. **Command Processing**: Intelligent parsing distinguishes between dictation, calculations, and drawing commands
3. **Content Generation**: Text is written, calculations are performed, or figures are drawn based on the command
4. **Audio Feedback**: The system reads back what was written, allowing users to verify and make corrections

## Technical Implementation

The system integrates multiple specialized modules:

- **Speech-to-Text API**: Converts spoken words to written text with academic vocabulary support
- **Compute API**: Handles mathematical expressions and calculations
- **Draw Figure API**: Generates geometric shapes and diagrams from voice descriptions
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Provides real-time auditory confirmation of all actions

## Impact

This invention addresses a critical gap in educational accessibility, enabling students with disabilities to:
- Take exams with complete independence
- Maintain privacy of their answers
- Eliminate dependency on human scribes
- Participate equally in academic assessments

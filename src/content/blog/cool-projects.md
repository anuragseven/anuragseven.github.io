## Introduction

Since I began programming I have built some really cool applications. The very first software I built was **"Talking Calculator"**. It was built using the .net framework and runs as a windows desktop application. Building it was both joy and pain. But it taught me some valuable things like **REST APIs**, how a **UI program** works, **asynchronous programming**, **databases** etc.

Since then I have coded nearly half a dozen apps and never looked back. Some were simple and some drove me crazy. I also didn't constrain myself to a single platform - I built a command line app, two desktop apps and two mobile apps, and now these days I am working on a web application. Anyway let's get started.

## Virtual-Scribe

Virtual Scribe is a research-based project which allows visually impaired students to write examinations without the need of a scribe. It is completely voice-controlled and allows writing, drawing figures, and performing calculations. We have developed a prototype of it in **PyQt5** and still working to make it industry-ready.

Recently **Virtual-Scribe** won first prize in a Hackathon conducted by [I-STEM](https://www.inclusivestem.org/).

## Beat The Culprit

A command line application built in Python. It uses **OpenCV** to detect faces from a video stream. The detected face is then sent to **Azure Face API** for recognition, to find whether it belongs to a criminal. If it is, the responsible authorities are notified using text messages.

It was quite fun to work on it. The app was built in just 200 lines of code!

## Where Is My

A cross platform app built using flutter framework. It keeps track of things a person often forgets about, things like keys, wallet, credit cards etc.

A user just needs to provide voice input (or can directly write) like **"I placed my wallet in the drawer"** and that's it, the app automatically finds sentiment of the phrase using **Natural Language Processing** technology.

To retrieve a lost key, wallet or any other object, the user just needs to say or write **"where is my key"** and the app will find its location. Since everything is stored in a cloud database, the user has access to his data on different devices, he just needs to sign in.

## Talking Calculator

It was the first app that I built. It was an academic project. It is a calculator but not an ordinary one. It has buttons but it can also accept voice inputs.

A user just needs to say **"Multiply 15 and 17"**, **"What is cosine of 90 degrees"** etc and our app will not only calculate and display the result but also speak back it to the user!

It was built to help visually impaired and other differently abled people. It was difficult but taught some valuable things. I designed the UI and coded a part of it while travelling in the train! It was built as a Windows Form Application.

## NASA APOD

A simple flutter app that uses NASA APOD REST API to deliver beautiful Astronomical Pictures to users. If you are interested, you can enjoy my tutorial which describes how it was built from scratch. It also tells you things like what are **Futures** and how to handle them.

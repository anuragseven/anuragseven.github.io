# About

Hello , I am Anurag , I am glad that you are here .Let me tell you a bit about myself.
I pursued my B.Tech Computer Science degree in 2017 and since then  I have been developing some really cool stuff . 
My college curriculum provided me a rudimentary knowledge of computer science and I quickly realised that it was
nowhere near to solve the real world problems . So I started teaching myself . Throughout this journey , I learned programming 
languages like **C** ,**C++** , **Java**  , **C#**  , **VB.NET** ,**Python** and  **Dart** .  I liked java , C# and Dart most .
I have also  built desktop applications using  **.NET framework** and **Universal Windows Platform** , but I have always been interested in developing for mobile . 
I first interacted with `Flutter` in december 2019 and quickly fell in love with it . Since then I have developed some cool cross platform apps .
Year 2020 has been good for me as I picked good habits like exercising , eating right , reading and writing along with my college studies and
teaching myself flutter and other tech skills .  I am an enthusiastic freelancer and looking forward to working on some exciting projects .
